# Hi there, I'm Ankit 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy solving problems, building things from scratch, and exploring how code can create meaningful impact — whether it's through robust backend systems or creative side projects.

## 🌱 What I'm currently working on

- Developing a full-stack **Internship + Resume Project Tracker**. This aims to streamline how students manage opportunities, deadlines, and personal growth — and doubles as a practical full-stack portfolio project.
- Learning advanced Java and Python concepts, with a focus on **arrays, algorithms, and data handling** — part of my personal prep for coding interviews.
- Iterating on a web app called **EqualVoice**, which aims to detect emotions in speech and give feedback using real-time analysis (HTML/CSS/JS + Python backend in progress).
